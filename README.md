# Quantum Circuit Simulator C++

A lightweight, work-in-progress quantum circuit simulator implemented in modern C++.

This project aims to provide a clean and educational implementation of a statevector-based quantum simulator, with optional Python bindings via pybind11. 
The focus is on clarity, correctness, and demonstrating an understanding of quantum computation, rather than reproducing the full feature set of frameworks like Qiskit.
